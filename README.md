# HTML_list

Hello everybody,

Today, I would like to share that I will dedicate my time to practicing and improving my HTML skills. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. Understanding and mastering HTML is critical for anyone interested in web development, as it is the foundation upon which all websites are built.
